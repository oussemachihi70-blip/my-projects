# 🦟 Malaria Prediction

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that explores a **Malaria prediction model** using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to **classify blood cell images** and predict whether cells are infected with malaria or not.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by *Plasmodium* parasites and transmitted through infected mosquitoes. Early diagnosis is essential to reduce mortality.  
This project aims to automate malaria detection using **image processing and machine learning**, helping improve accuracy and speed compared to manual diagnosis.
